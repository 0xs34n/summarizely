- Course/education marketplace

## Technical Architecture

### MVP Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind (you already have this)
- **Backend:** Node.js + PostgreSQL
- **AI:** OpenAI API initially, migrate to Groq/Together for speed
- **Queue:** Redis + BullMQ for async processing
- **Storage:** S3 for summaries, Redis for cache

### Scaling Considerations

- WebSockets for collaborative features
- Consider Cloudflare Workers for global distribution

## Differentiation Strategy

### vs YouTube
- We save time, they maximize watch time
- We compress, they expand
- We're learning-focused, they're entertainment-focused

### vs ChatGPT/Claude
- We're specialized for consumption, they're general
- We have a feed/social layer, they're single-player
- We're optimized for speed, they're optimized for capability

### vs Blinkist
- We summarize everything, they curate
- We're real-time, they're pre-processed
- We're social, they're solo

### vs Perplexity
- We're proactive (feed), they're reactive (search)
- We're entertainment-friendly, they're research-focused
- We build knowledge over time, they answer questions

## Feature Prioritization Framework

Every feature must score on:
1. **Speed Impact:** Does it make learning faster?
2. **Viral Potential:** Will users share/talk about it?
3. **Retention Value:** Does it bring users back daily?
4. **Moat Building:** Does it create lock-in?

Only build features scoring 8+ on at least two dimensions.

## The Magic Moments

1. **First Summary:** "Holy shit, I just understood 2 hours in 30 seconds"
2. **First Share:** "My friend loved that summary I sent"
3. **First Streak:** "I've learned something new for 7 days straight"
4. **First Follow:** "This person finds the best content"
5. **First Addiction:** "I check Summarizely before YouTube now"
