## The Meta Risk

**The biggest risk is not moving fast enough.** Every day delayed is a day competitors could launch, platforms could change policies, or opportunities could close.

**Mitigation:** Launch imperfect but functional MVP in 4 weeks. Iterate based on real user feedback, not assumptions.

## Risk Acceptance

Some risks we consciously accept:
1. Platform dependency initially (speed > diversification)
2. Limited monetization initially (growth > revenue)
3. Imperfect summaries initially (launch > perfection)
4. Legal gray areas (innovation > complete safety)

The key is moving fast enough that we can adapt before any single risk becomes fatal.

**Our philosophy:** It's better to ask forgiveness than permission, but always be ready with Plan B.
