## Day 0: Testing & Setup (COMPLETED âœ…)

### PRIORITY 1: Test YouTube Extraction Methods

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Tested youtube-transcript-api (Python) - Works great!
- [x] Evaluated JS/TS packages - All outdated/unreliable
- [x] Built transcript-service microservice with FastAPI
- [x] Tested with 5 different video types

#### Test Results
- **Python Success Rate:** 80% (4/5 videos)
- **JS Packages:** Not viable (outdated, poor quality)
- **Decision:** Python-only approach with microservices

#### What We Built
- `backend/transcript-service/` - Production-ready Python service
- FastAPI endpoint at `/extract`
- Docker containerized for deployment
- Successfully extracts transcripts in 1-2 seconds

## Daily Standups (5 min self-check)

Ask yourself each morning:
1. What did I ship yesterday?
2. What will I ship today?
3. What's blocking me?
4. Am I on track for Friday launch?

---

## Not Doing This Week

Explicitly NOT building:
- User authentication
- Multiple summary styles
- Browser extension
- Payment processing
- Podcast support
- Email digests
- Social features
- Mobile app

These can wait until we validate the core idea works.

---

## Emergency Pivots

### If YouTube extraction completely fails:
1. Build browser extension instead (user's browser extracts)
2. Focus on podcast RSS feeds
3. Manual submission form for creators

### If costs spiral:
1. Reduce to 1 summary/day limit
2. Use only GPT-3.5-turbo
3. Require email for access

### If no one uses it:
1. Don't panic - it's week 1
2. Do user interviews
3. Try different positioning
4. Consider different traffic sources

## Week 1 Motto

**"Ship something broken that teaches you something over planning something perfect that teaches you nothing."**

Focus: Get real feedback from real users by Friday night.
